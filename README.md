# Winforms Browser 
Simple browser that takes in URLs and shows data such as the websites status code, response message, title of the webpage and it's returned HTML code. For example https://google.com: 

<p align="center">
<img width="590" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b207f8d-1687-46d0-b2f0-f7f2c2317a6a" />
</p>

Other features include adding favourite sites, a working history, downloading the websites HTML code and standard browser shortcuts. You are also able to navigate forwards and backwards and refresh pages like a normal browser and with the ability to set custom homepages. Basic shortcuts also work such as ctrl + H to go to the home page. 

To run, navigate to Browser/bin/Debug/app.publish/ and lauch the exe file.
